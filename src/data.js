          "Sandra was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, and at the age of 10 she moved to New Jersey, United States. She set foot on Argentine soil for the first time almost when she turned 18. She entered the Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry of the UBA, where she studied Pharmacy. Despite her many professional opportunities in the United States, she decided to stay in Argentina. After studying History for a few years, also at the UBA, she returned to the path of Biochemistry, obtaining a doctorate in Plant Biotechnology. She became a CONICET Researcher in 2002, working on plant tissue culture and genetic engineering to obtain products of industrial interest and on improving the architecture of ornamental plants using molecular biology techniques; among other topics. Her passion for cinema, literature and history was always shared with her other passion, Exact Sciences. Her interest in producing changes in CONICET led her to venture into union activity and government advice.",

After finishing high school, she continued her tertiary studies, graduating as a physical trainer and is currently studying a “crime scene” university technical career. Since she was a child, she dreamed of being a firefighter, and boy did she achieve it: in 2005 she joined the Villa La Angostura Volunteer Firefighters, and 5 years ago she became Head of the Barracks, with the hierarchy of Principal Officer. In 2018 she was distinguished as an "outstanding personality" for her work as a woman in such an important social role.',

Since childhood he has developed a particular taste for mechanics, along with a passion for off-road motorcycle racing. At the age of 22, together with a friend, he arrived on a motorcycle from the United States to Argentina, and fell in love with our country. He lives in Villa la Angostura since 1961, and has developed multiple activities, highlighting the organization of the first motocross and enduro competitions in our country. He has also ventured into different commercial activities (timber, gastronomy, lake transportation, etc.) and has committed himself to different local intermediary entities (associations and clubs, among many others). He devised and developed the ski center at Cerro Bayo. In 1977 he married in Belgium and returned to his wife Bernadette, who knew how to adapt to such an original husband in a place so different and distant from Belgium, forming a beautiful family with three children and three grandchildren, all of them very Angosturan. At just over 81 years old, Jean Pierre is a much-loved and respected figure in our town.",
